## C#
C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language.

C# is just a simple, secure, robust, portable, platform-independent, architectural neutral, multithreaded, object-oriented programming language 
with a strong type exception handling mechanism for developing different kinds of applications such as Web, Windows Form, Console, Web Services, 
Mobile Apps, etc.

Several C# features help create robust and durable applications. [Garbage collection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/) 
automatically reclaims memory occupied by unreachable unused objects. [Nullable types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references) 
guard against variables that don't refer to allocated objects. [Exception handling](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/exceptions/) 
provides a structured and extensible approach to error detection and recovery. [Lambda expressions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/lambda-expressions) 
support functional programming techniques. [Language Integrated Query (LINQ)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/linq/) syntax 
creates a common pattern for working with data from any source. Language support for [asynchronous operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/) 
provides syntax for building distributed systems. C# has a [unified type system](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/). 
All C# types, including primitive types such as int and double, inherit from a single root object type.


## Types of Applications Developed using C#:

**With the help of the C# programming language, we can develop different types of secured and robust applications:**

1. Window Applications
2. Web Applications
3. Distributed Applications
4. Web Service Applications
5. Database Applications
6. Mobile Applications, Etc.


## Features of C#

Although C# constructs closely follow traditional high-level languages, C and C++ and being an object-oriented programming languages. It has a strong resemblance with Java, it has numerous strong programming features that make it endearing to a number of programmers worldwide. Following is the list of a few important features of C# −

1. **Simple:** C# is a simple language in the sense that it provides a structured approach (to break the problem into parts), a rich set of 
	library functions, data types, etc.
2. **Modern Programming Language:** C# programming is based upon the current trend and it is very powerful and simple for building scalable, 
	interoperable, and robust applications.
3. **Object-Oriented:** C# is an object-oriented programming language. OOPs makes development and maintenance easier whereas in Procedure-oriented 
	programming language it is not easy to manage if code grows as the project size grows.
4. **Type-Safe:** C# type safe code can only access the memory location that it has permission to execute. Therefore, it improves the security of 
	the program.
5. **Interoperability:** The interoperability process enables the C# programs to do almost anything that a native C++ application can do.
6. **Scalable and Updateable:** C# is an automatic scalable and updateable programming language. For updating our application, we delete the old 
	files and update them with new ones.
7. **Component Oriented:** C# is a component-oriented programming language. It is the predominant software development methodology used to develop 
	more robust and highly scalable applications.
8. **Structured Programming Language:** C# is a structured programming language in the sense that we can break the program into parts using 
	functions. So, it is easy to understand and modify.
9. **Rich Library:** C# provides a lot of inbuilt functions that make development fast.
10. **Fast Speed:** The compilation and execution time of the C# language is fast.
