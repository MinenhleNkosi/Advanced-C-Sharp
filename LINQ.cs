# What is LINQ?
The LINQ (**Language Integrated Query**) is a part of a language but not a complete language. It was introduced by Microsoft with .NET Framework 3.5 and C# 3.0 and is available in System.Linq 
namespace.

LINQ provides us with common query syntax which allows us to query the data from various data sources. That means using a single query we can get or set the data from various data sources such as 
SQL Server database, XML documents, ADO.NET Datasets, and any other in-memory objects such as Collections, Generics, etc.

## Why use LINQ?
So, LINQ provides a **uniform programming model which will make it easy to work with different data sources by using a standard coding style. That means we don't require different syntaxes to 
query different data sources.
